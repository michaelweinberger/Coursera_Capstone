2. Data
The project uses neighbourhood data (names and locations) from four cities: San Francisco, New York, Toronto and London.

The San Francisco data have been used in the Data Visualization with Python course (https://cocl.us/sanfran_geojson). 
Names were isolated from the geojson file "features" sections and "properties" subsections. 
The mean values of the "geometry" section and "coordinates" subsection values for each neighbourhood were used as neighbourhood locations.

The New York neighbourhood name and location data are taken from https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.json (as used in week 3 of the Data Science Capstone Project course). 
Names were isolated from the json file "properties" sections and "name" subsections. Locations were isolated from the "geometry" sections and "coordinates" subsections.

The Toronto neighbourhood name data are taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, more specifically from the "Toronto - 103 FSAs" table on the website. 
The neighbourhood location data was acquired from http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data (as used in week 3 of the Data Science Capstone Project course) and merged with the name data using the postal code information.

The London neighbourhood name and location data are taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs. 
The "List of boroughs and local authorities" table on the website was used to get names and coordinates of the London neighbourhoods.

Data on venues was acquired using the Foursquare API (https://foursquare.com/). 
Venue data was collected for each neighbourhood location, as well as for the user-supplied location, using a search radius of 500 meters and an upper limit of 100 found venues. 
Venue data was collected using personal Foursquare developers account credentials.

The venue data was then summarised for each venue type, such that a table of venue occurrence counts was created.
The venue data for each neighbourhood was used to cluster the neighbourhoods according to venue count similarity.
Finally, the neighbourhoods were ranked according to their clustering distance from the user-supplied location.
