1. Introduction/Business Problem
In today's world people frequently need to relocate, be it due to work requirements or for personal reasons. 
Often, this involves moving to a city that you have not lived in before and may never have visited.

So how do you decide which part of a city that you do not yet know you would prefer to live in?

One way would be to base this decision on past experience and start from a neighbourhood that you know and like. 
You would then choose a new neighbourhood based on the fact that is very similar to the one you like. 

This project allows you to do just that: It uses data on the presence of various kinds of local venues (https://foursquare.com/) to determine neighbourhoods that best match a location freely chosen by the user. 

The project therefore is aimed at a broad audience, namely anyone who would like a personalised recommendation on which new neighbourhood best to move to. 
It therefore addresses a common need. It is distinct from existing property marketing resources in that it helps to choose a neighbourhood, rather than a specific property.
To reach its audience, the project can be implemented as a web-based app. The app would furthermore be able to give additional information, such as the kinds of venues that define a chosen neighbourhood.
